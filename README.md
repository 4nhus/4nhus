### Greetings 👋

I'm Anh, a software engineer who pivoted from medicine to pursue my passion for technology 👨‍⚕️➡️👨‍💻. There were several reasons for this, though above all computer science aligned better with my vision for my professional career 🧐. Even after just one year it was very clear to me that I had made the right choice - since transferring I'm grateful 🙏 that I've been able to constantly to cultivate my passion for technology further 🤩.

Outside of full-time work and uni I've been up-skilling in full stack development, exploring:
- 📱 Mobile development via iOS apps built with Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit and other core Apple technologies like CoreData, CoreMotion, CoreImage, MapKit, and AVFoundation.
- 🍑 Backend development via servers for RESTful APIs built with Java, Spring Boot, and relational databases 
- 🕸️ Web development via projects built with both the fundamentals of Javascript/HTML/CSS and libraries like React/Tailwind

I'm currently working on deploying my first iOS app to the app store! You can see my projects on my [portfolio](https://4nhus.github.io/portfolio/) or have a browse through my repositories. I can be contacted via my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anh-nguyen-41870b156/).
